# VITA Project
An Appointment Scheduling and Management Web Application for Lincoln VITA

## Background
The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Coalition is an IRS program that helps under-privileged populations file their tax returns free of charge. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln runs a VITA location for the residents of Lincoln and the surrounding areas. 

## Problem
In the past, Lincoln VITA struggled to schedule the 3,000+ tax appointments it has every year: Their online spreadsheet solution was not handling the scale and volunteers were kept busy answering the phone line instead of doing other value-generating activities. 

## Solution
This project aims to alleviate the stresses experienced by the VITA volunteers by getting enabling clients to schedule their own appointments online thus eliminating the need for clients to contact VITA volunteers. This solution is an appointment scheduling and management solution that lets volunteers sign up for shifts, clients sign up for appointments where volunteers are signed up, and (physical) site managers to manage volunteers/clients.

## Metrics
During the 2018 tax season, this solution helped Lincoln VITA schedule over 2,300 appointments and saved more than 40 volunteer hours.
